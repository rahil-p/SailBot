# SailBot

Overview:  SailBot uses a genetic algorithm (determined by fitness, survival, crossover, and mutation functions) to develop neural networks that can sail efficiently in the [SailSim environment](https://github.com/rahil-p/SailSim).

Progress:  Steering capabilities are often developed in early generations.  However, the neural networks evolve very slowly and generations devolve in certain cases, e.g. when the boats spawn "in irons" (i.e. facing the wind direction with limited movement). *Such shortcomings are being addressed in ongoing commits.*
