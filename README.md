# SailBot



Overview:  SailBot uses a genetic algorithm (determined by fitness, survival, crossover, and mutation functions) to develop neural networks that can sail efficiently in the [SailSim environment](https://github.com/rahil-p/SailSim).

*SailBot's maneuvering capabilities (through steering and mainsheet control) are well developed by the 200th generation.  Current goals include implementing a third neural network to map new destinations intermediate to the the regatta destination; intermediate destinations would allow for tacking (i.e. zig-zagging to travel upwind)*
